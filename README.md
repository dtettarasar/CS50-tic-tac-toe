# CS50x - Tic Tac Toe

#### Description:

Source code for my CS50x's final project

The project is a Tic Tac Toe Game, running in the browser. Built with HTML, CSS and JS. 

The game allows you to choose between **3 game modes** : 

- **1 player (easy)** : play against an easy AI, that will randomly pick a case
- **1 player (difficult)** : play against a difficult AI. This time, the AI will be using the Minimax algorithm, that won't let you win. This algorithm was integrated in this tic tac toe game, with the help of the tutorial from The Coding Train (links are available below, and in the JS file)
- **2 players** : play against another human player

At the end of each game, the scores for each players are displayed. And the number of games played are also tracked. You'll get options to play again or, change game mode.
